    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is based on the classic Alfredo sauce, which, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it, is a combination
        of cream, butter, salt, parmesan, and garlic. It is typically served with a wider noodle, like fettucine,
        and is popular paired with grilled chicken. Here, we will focus on the base dish, and leave the chicken 
        recipe to others.
