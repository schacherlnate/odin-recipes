    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is based on the classic Alfredo sauce, which, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it, is a combination
        of cream, butter, salt, parmesan, and garlic. It is typically served with a wider noodle, like fettucine,
        and is popular paired with grilled chicken. Here, we will focus on the base dish, and leave the chicken 
        recipe to others.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2lbs Shrimp</li>
        <li>1lb Angel Hair Pasta</li>
        <li>1 Stick of Butter</li>
        <li>4tbs Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>3 Lemons</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Dry White Wine</li>
        <li>1lb Asparagus</li>
        <li>1lb Roma Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook fettucine for 8-10 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>Next we will cook the shrimp. Mince 8 cloves of garlic.
            Then, put a large skillet over medium heat with olive oil and butter.
            Once the pan is hot enough, sprinkle in some red pepper flakes. After
            30 seconds, add the shrimp and garlic. Sautee both sides for about 2 minutes,
            and then remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the shrimp into a bowl, and then return the pan to heat, adding additional oil and butter.
            Add the asparagus, cook, and then remove it, keeping the pan on. Poor in the wine and reduce
            for several minutes, to about half. Add the lemon juice, salt, pepper, and asparagus. After a minute, add the shrimp and reduce heat to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to taste the sauce, as it is easy to modify - optionally add salt, pepper for more spice,
            flour or corn starch to thicken, or baking soda if it's too acidic.
        </li>
        <li>Bring the water to the boil and begin cooking the pasta. While that's happening,
            chop up some parsely. Optionally, grate some cheese, such as parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done, pour some of the water into the scampi sauce. This will thicken it. Strain it. Portion out the pasta into dishes,
            and then put scampi sauce and shrimp over it. Finally, add the parsley, parmesan,
            and salt and pepper to taste. And oila! It's done.
        </li>
    </ol>
